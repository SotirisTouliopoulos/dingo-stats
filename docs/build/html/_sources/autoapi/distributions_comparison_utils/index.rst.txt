.. py:function:: significantly_altered_reactions(conditions=[], selected_comparisons=[(0, 1)], cobra_model=None, p_value_cutoff=0.05, fold_change_cutoff=1.2, std_cutoff=0.01)

   Function that takes as input at least 2 conditions to compare (diffeent sampling dataset) 
   and performs the KS non-parametric test and based on a multiple-comparisons corrected p-value and fold change classifies
   reactions as significantly altered or not. This function can provide reactions that can further filter graphs
